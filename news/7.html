<p>The outbreak of West Nile virus this year has spread to nearly every state and is shaping up to be the largest one on record since the first human cases were reported in the United States in 1999.
To find out more about the disease and the factors fueling the current outbreak, we spoke with Dr. Erin Staples, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p><b>Is it true that many of the symptoms of West Nile are easily overlooked? How many people probably have it and don’t know it?</b></p>
<p>From studies we know that only about one in every five people who get infected with West Nile will actually develop symptoms. The most common ones are fever, headaches, body ache, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea and rash.</p>

<p><b>How does a person know if he or she has a more serious form of the illness? What symptoms should prompt you to see a doctor?</b></p>
<p>Symptoms of severe neurological disease due to West Nile virus infection can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks, and neurological effects may be permanent.</p>

<p>Less than 1 percent of people who are infected will develop such symptoms of more serious neurological illness, like encephalitis or meningitis, which is inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissue.</p>

<p><b>How do you find out if you have West Nile? Is there a test?</b></p>
<p>People who have symptoms that concern them should see a health care provider. If they think they have West Nile, they can have their blood tested for the presence of antibodies or, in more severe cases that affect the central nervous system, a doctor can take samples of the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.</p>

<p><b>Are certain groups at higher risk?</b></p>
<p>Anyone who is outdoors during times when mosquitoes are active is at a higher risk — so that means people who go outside at dusk and dawn who haven’t done anything to prevent getting bitten, like using repellents or wearing pants and long sleeves.</p>

<p><b>How does this compare with other West Nile outbreaks?</b></p>
<p>We definitely have received reports from state health departments of earlier and greater West Nile activity, particularly in the central states. It’s more than we’ve seen in recent years, and we’re not quite sure why. Essentially there are several factors that play a role, including the weather, the number and types of mosquitoes that spread the virus, birds that also spread the virus, what people are doing to prevent it, and whether there’s community-based spraying.</p>

<p><b>What steps can people take to protect themselves?</b></p>
<p>Use insect repellents when you go outdoors. Wear long sleeves and pants to prevent mosquito bites at dusk and dawn. Install or repair screens or windows to prevent mosquitoes from getting inside your home. Empty any containers of standing water around your home - things like flower pots, kiddie pools, buckets and sometimes even gutters, which can have standing water in them.</p>
